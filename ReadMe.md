Debug mode is fast and unoptimized build , compiler includes additional metadata
Release mode takes longer to compile but optimizes runtime performance
final executable will be inside the target

`cargo check` checks for compiler violation // skips the creation of an executable

A compiler directive is when we add some meta data in the code which then directs the compiler to behave in a certain way.
