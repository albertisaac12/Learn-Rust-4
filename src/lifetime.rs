// CONCRETE LIFE TIME : = life time of a variable is clearly defined its concrete
// lifetime is basically for a compiler to understand when the variable came into existence and when the existence ends

// Reference will not outlive the data its referencing too, if it did the reference would turn to a dangling reference so the compiler does not allow it

// A reference is contained within the lifetime of a variable/ data it is referring to.

// The borrow checker is the part of the rust compiler that validates that all borrows (i.e references) are valid



/*

    Non-Lexical Lifetimes
    The word lexical Means lasting until the end of the block. Non-Lexical means not lasting until the end of the block
    The borrow checker treats the end of a reference's lifetime as the last place it is used; a reference has non-lexical scope.


    if the reference was created and never used rust assumes that the reference could be used in the future hence and the lifetime will move on until it will be used.

    when the lifetime of a reference outlives the lifetime of the data/variable its borrowing from it creates a dangling reference
